This is the second project being undertaken by the Metaverse Academy, simulating the "Doronco Wanko" game.
In the Doronco Wanko game, players can become puppy and dirtying the house.
Then you can find the mission stamps hidden in the house, and if you find them all, the closed party room opens inside the house and you can see the ending of the game by interacting with the objects inside it.
